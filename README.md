# custom-cli
This is a custom cli helping for my daily needs

Built a cli using javascript to help me do repeated tasks in single command like a make file.

## Features
- Adds all files, commit and push to git 
- If icon name is provided, prefixes icon to commit message
- If branch is provided, uses a different command to push to git assuming it is a new branch.

note: This is built to cater my needs but feel glad to fork and change it as per your requirements.
